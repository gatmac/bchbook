# Mastering Bitcoin Cash

Mastering Bitcoin Cash is a book for developers, although the first two chapters cover bitcoin at a level that is also approachable to non-programmers. Anyone with a basic understanding of technology can read the first two chapters to get a great understanding of Bitcoin Cash.

This repository is derived from the complete Mastering Bitcoin [first edition, second print](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/releases/tag/Edition1Print2), published in December 2014, and the complete [second edition, third print](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/releases/tag/second_edition_print3_rc1), published in March 2018, by Andreas M. Antonopoulos as published by O'Reilly Media in paperback and ebook formats.

No funding has been sought for this effort, in the form of Flipstarters or any other appeal, directly or indirectly.

This book makes references to Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin Core. The term Bitcoin may refer to the system prior to the hard fork, or may refer to features or capabilities that are common to pre-fork Bitcoin and post-fork Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core. Bitcoin Cash may refer to pre-fork Bitcoin, or to post-fork Bitcoin Cash in order to distinguish it from Bitcoin Core.
