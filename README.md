# Mastering Bitcoin Cash

Mastering Bitcoin Cash is a book for developers, although the first two chapters cover bitcoin at a level that is also approachable to non-programmers. Anyone with a basic understanding of technology can read the first two chapters to get a great understanding of bitcoin.

This repository is derived from the complete [first edition, second print](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/releases/tag/Edition1Print2), published in December 2014, and the complete [second edition, third print](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/releases/tag/second_edition_print3_rc1), published in March 2018, as published by O'Reilly Media in paperback and ebook formats.
